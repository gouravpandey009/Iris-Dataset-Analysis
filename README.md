# Iris-Dataset-Analysis

**Project Title:** Iris Dataset Analysis and Classification

**Overview:**
This project aims to analyze the famous Iris dataset and build a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers into different species based on their features. The Iris dataset is widely used in machine learning and serves as a good starting point for beginners due to its simplicity and clear class separation.

**Key Features:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the distribution of features, explore relationships between variables, and identify any patterns or trends in the data.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into features and target labels.
- Model Selection: Train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Model Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the models to improve performance using techniques like grid search or random search.
- GitHub Integration: Utilize GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
